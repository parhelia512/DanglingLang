Introduction
------------

This is a small project realized for the academic course "Implementation of Programming Languages", taught by [Giovanni Lagorio](http://www.disi.unige.it/person/LagorioG/) and [Davide Ancona](http://www.disi.unige.it/person/AnconaD/) at the [University of Genoa](http://www.dibris.unige.it/index.php). All kind of material stored on this repository is public domain.

"Dangling" is a simple language, whose goal was to let us understand how one can write a compiler and which are the difficulties involved. If you are wondering why the language is called "Dangling" and why the "logo" of the tool chain is [Rocco Siffredi](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Siffredi)... Well, we will let you wonder :)

The tools that have been used to realize this project were:
* Visual Studio 2012: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio
* Garden Points Parser Generator: http://gppg.codeplex.com/
* Mono.Cecil: http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil
* NUnit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUnit
